Missiles launched into Ukraine from Belarus
Iskander missiles were launched from Belarus into Ukraine around 17:00 (15:00 GMT), an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says.

It comes after President Zelensky's office announced today that Ukrainian and Russian officials are due to meet for talks on the Belarusian border with Ukraine - although they have not said when.

Anton Herashchenko posted the footage on Facebook.

Iskanders launched against Ukraine from the vicinity of Mozyr, he wrote. This means they've brought death somewhere... so this is the kind of ceasefire we have?

A Ukrainian statement earlier said that Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko had taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, talks and return.
