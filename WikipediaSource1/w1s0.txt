On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014. The invasion has likely resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides and caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II,[10][11] with an estimated 8 million people being displaced within the country by late May as well as 7.7 million Ukrainians fleeing the country as of 18 October 2022.[12][13][14][15] Within five weeks of the invasion, Russia experienced its greatest emigration since the 1917 October Revolution.[16] The invasion has also caused global food shortages.[17][18]
Following the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed paramilitaries seized part of the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine, which consists of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, sparking a regional war.[19][20] In March 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops and their equipment. Despite the build-up, denials of plans to invade or attack Ukraine were issued by various Russian government officials up to the day before the invasion.[24] On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed breakaway quasi-states in the Donbas.[25] The next day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force and Russian troops entered both territories.[26]
The invasion began on the morning of 24 February,[27] when Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.[28][29] In his address, Putin espoused irredentist views,[30] challenged Ukraine's right to statehood,[31][32] and falsely[33] claimed Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority.[34] Minutes later, missiles, rockets and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions.[35][36] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and a general mobilisation.[37][38] Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from Luhansk and Donetsk.[39][40] Russia's advance towards Kyiv stalled in March, with Russian troops retreating from the northern front by April. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and then Mariupol in May after a siege. On 19 April, Russia launched a renewed attack on the Donbas region, with Luhansk Oblast fully captured by 3 July.[41] Russian forces continued to bomb both military and civilian targets far from the frontline.[42][43] Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August, and in the northeast in September. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts.
The invasion has received widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full withdrawal of Russian forces.[44] The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia, as well as on its ally Belarus, which have affected the economies of Russia and the world,[45] and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine,[46] totalling over $80B from 40 countries as of August 2022.[47] Protests occurred around the world; those in Russia were met with mass arrests and increased media censorship,[48][49] including a ban on the words war and invasion.[36][50] Over 1,000 companies have pulled out of Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion.[51] The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in Ukraine since 2013, including war crimes in the 2022 invasion.[52]
After the Soviet Union (USSR) dissolved in 1991, the newly independent republics of Ukraine and Russia maintained ties. Ukraine agreed in 1994 to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and dismantle the nuclear weapons in Ukraine left by the USSR.[53] In return, Russia, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine.[54][55] In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, which reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating state to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance.[56] After the Soviet Union collapsed, several former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO, partly due to regional security threats such as the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) and the First Chechen War (1994–1996). Russian leaders claimed Western powers pledged that NATO would not expand eastward, although this is disputed.[57][58][59]
Following the Euromaidan protests and the Revolution of Dignity which resulted in the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. Russian soldiers without insignia took control of strategic positions and infrastructure in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament. Russia organised a controversial referendum, whose outcome was for Crimea to join Russia. Russia's annexation of Crimea followed in March 2014, then the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 with the formation of two Russia-backed separatist quasi-states: the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic.[60][61] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[62][63][64] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[65]

A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[66][67] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government subsequently endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a vassal of the US.[68] The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land, including the unrecognised Novorossiya.[69] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation of Crimea was a de facto manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism.[70] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, reaffirming that Russians and Ukrainians were one people.[71] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[72] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[73] Other observers have noted that the Russian leadership has a distorted view of modern Ukraine and its history.[74][75][76]
In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[78] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[22][79] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[21] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[22] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[23][80] Putin's chief national security adviser, Nikolai Patrushev,[81] believed that the West had been in an undeclared war with Russia for years.[82] Russia's updated national security strategy, published in May 2021, said that Russia may use forceful methods to thwart or avert unfriendly actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.[83][84] Sources say the decision to invade Ukraine was made by Putin and a small group of war hawks in Putin's inner circle, including Patrushev and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.[85]

During the second build-up, Russia demanded that the US and NATO enter into a legally binding arrangement preventing Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and remove multinational forces from NATO's Eastern European member states.[86] Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an aggressive line.[87] These demands were widely seen as non-viable; new NATO members in Central and Eastern Europe had joined the alliance because they preferred the safety and economic opportunities offered by NATO and the EU, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.[88] A formal treaty to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO would contravene the treaty's open door policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.[89] Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz made respective efforts to prevent the war in February. Macron met with Putin but failed to convince him not to go forward with the attack. Scholz warned Putin about heavy sanctions that would be imposed should he invade Ukraine. Scholz, in trying to negotiate a settlement, also told Zelenskyy to renounce aspirations to join NATO and declare neutrality; however, Zelenskyy said Putin could not be trusted to uphold such an agreement.[90]

Putin's address to the nation on 24 February (English subtitles available)— minutes after Putin's announcement, the invasion began.
On 24 February, before 5:00 a.m. Kyiv time,[91] Putin announced a special military operation in eastern Ukraine and effectively declared war on Ukraine.[92][93] In his speech, Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukrainian territory and that he supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[94] He said the purpose of the operation was to protect the people in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbas who he falsely claimed that for eight years now, [had] been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.[95] Putin said that Russia sought for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.[96] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, explosions were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and the Donbas region.[97] An alleged leaked report from within the FSB claimed that the intelligence agency was not warned of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[98] Immediately following the attack, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine.[99] The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old[38] who were prohibited from leaving the country.[100] Russian troops entered Ukraine from the north in Belarus (towards Kyiv); from the north-east in Russia (towards Kharkiv); from the east in the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic; and from the south in Crimea.[101] Russian equipment and vehicles were marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.[78]
The invasion began at dawn of 24 February,[92] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[102][103] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40 am Kyiv time.[104] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearhead incursions, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv, a southern front originating in Crimea, a south-eastern front launched at the cities of Luhansk and Donbas, and an eastern front.[39][40]

Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine reached as far west as Lviv.[105][106] Wagner Group mercenaries and Chechen forces reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian government said these efforts were thwarted by anti-war officials in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), who shared intelligence of the plans.[107] The Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance.[108] In Kyiv, Russia failed to take the city as its attacks were repulsed at the suburbs during the battles of Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha. The Russian army tried to encircle the capital but Ukrainian forces managed to hold ground and put to effective use Western arms, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, stretching thin Russian supply lines and stalling the offensive.[109]

On 9 March, a column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed in Brovary, suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat.[110] On the northern front, the Russian army adopted siege tactics to the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.[111] On the southern front, Russian forces captured the major city of Kherson on 2 March. In Mykolaiv Oblast, it advanced as far as Voznesensk but was repelled to south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry said the first stage of the military operation in Ukraine was generally complete, that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the liberation of Donbas.[112][113] The first stage of the invasion was conducted on four fronts[114][115] including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus, conducted by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (north-eastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.[116]
